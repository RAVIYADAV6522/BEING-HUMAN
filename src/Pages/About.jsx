          <p className=" py-3 text-white">
            Helping wounded animals is a moral responsibility that reflects our
            compassion and care for all living beings. Injured animals often
            cannot heal on their own, and by offering assistance, we relieve
            their suffering and give them a chance to survive.
          </p>

          <p className=" py-3 text-white">
            Helping a wounded animal may seem like a small gesture, but to that
            animal, it means the worldâ€”a moment of kindness that could change
            their fate forever.
